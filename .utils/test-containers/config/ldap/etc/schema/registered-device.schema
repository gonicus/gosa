# Attribute: deviceUUID
#
# This attribute keeps a unique indentifier for a device that should be
# registered to the GOsa services. It is used as a unique key to find
# the relationship of the registered device to other information like
# inventory, received events and logging data.
#
# The device UUID is a string defined in RFC 4122. It can be generated
# by the command line utility 'uuid' in various flavors.

# Attribute: deviceStatus
#
# The deviceStatus attribute represents several states a system can represent.
# Note that this is the current status - i.e. no history of states is
# recordable this way. The attribute is mostly used to quickly determine
# the state without reading system logs.
#
# The attribute is encoded this way:
#
# deviceStatus ::= [<option>*]
#
# <option> is a single character describing the state:
#   O: System is switched on
#   o: System is switched off
#   u: Update available
#   U: Update in progress
#   i: Inventory in progress
#   C: Configuration in progress
#   I: Installation in progress
#   V: Virtual machine creation in progress
#   W: Warning
#   E: Error
#   B: System has active user sessions
#   A: System activated
#   a: System locked

# Attribute: deviceType
#
# To order systems, you can mark a system i.e. as a server.
# Valid device types are:
#
#  terminal
#  workstation
#  server
#  sipphone
#  switch
#  router
#  printer

# Object: registeredDevice
#
# The registeredDevice is a device that is known to GOsa and will be displayed
# additional information.
#
# A registeredDevice is a specialization of the device object type and is
# designed to work in conjunction with it. It can be extended with the
# following classes:
#
# device, ieee802Device, bootableDevice, ipHost, simpleSecurityObject
